Description: Implements self-organising maps combined with hierarchical cluster analysis (SOM-HCA) for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data.
    The package includes functions to estimate the optimal map size based on various quality measures
    and to generate a model using the selected dimensions.
    It also performs hierarchical clustering on the map nodes to group similar units.
    Documentation about the SOM-HCA method is provided in Pastorelli et al. (2024)
